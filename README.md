# Imifai

A smarter way to search your local photos!

This app uses the Clarifai API and feature detection to automatically tag on your local photos. When you take a picture, it is automatically tagged based on the features that are in it. You can then easily search through your local photos based on the tags that the app has generated. The app has its own smart search engine that allows searching by multiple tags and auto-suggests tags based on what it has seen in the past.
